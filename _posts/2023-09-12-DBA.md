Excited to TA for CS 577 Introduction to Algorithm (Honor Section) this semester under Professor [Eric Bach](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bach/bach.html). This course is newly designed and will introduce many algorithm ideas through the lens of the Travelling Sales Problem. 

Looking forward to leading the weekly recitation classes and learning with the students!
