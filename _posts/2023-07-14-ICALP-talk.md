Gave a (virtual) talk on ICALP today! Here is my [slide](https://austen-z-fan.github.io/assets/slides/ICALP_2023_Presentation.pdf) for the talk.

A fun fact: I got up at 4:00 am (New Jersey) to join the ICALP virtually, listened the wonderful talks and gave my talk at 6:10 am. After the ICALP talk I then did something else and gave an intern presentation during Bell Labs DSR meeting at 9:00. The meeting lasts until 11:00. 

What a morning! :-) It is interesting to find that I am much more tolerant to the lack of sleep now.
